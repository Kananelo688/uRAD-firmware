# uRAD-firmware
This Respository Write the firmware for reading RAW RADAR data from uRAD RADAR System.
## Introduction
RADAR (Radio Rangind And Detection) is an electronic device that transmits high energy electromagnetic waves and listens from the reflected waves from targets. With with reflect waves, information abou the target such as its distance from RADAR, its speed relative to RADAR, and its cross-sectional area of the target can be estimated. This project focus on low-cost,high-performance uRAD RADAR system. The goal is to develop a python firmware library that has aa script that is capable of running reading raw RADAR data from the uRAD system. The firmware library was updated by Queto Jenkins.
